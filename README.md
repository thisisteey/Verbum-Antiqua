# Verbum Antiqua "The Ancient Word"
Verbum Antiqua is a social media platform where users can share quotes and ancient words of wisdom. The project aims to create a community for enthusiasts of timeless knowledge, offering features such as user authentication, posting updates and interacting with posts.
My goal is to create a space where like-minded individuals can share their favorite quotes and words from the past, preserving their meanings for generations to come.
I am excited to embark on this journey, which will involve a blend of technical challenges, creativity, and fulfillment as I pursue my passion for preserving ancient quotes.
